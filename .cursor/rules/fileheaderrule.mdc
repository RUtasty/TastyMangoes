# TastyMangoes – Swift File Header Rule

For **every Swift file** you create or modify in this project, follow these rules.

---

## 1. New Swift files

When generating **any new Swift file**, always include this header at the very top of the file:

```swift
//
//  <FileName>.swift
//  TastyMangoes
//
//  Created automatically by Cursor Assistant on <YYYY-MM-DD> at <HH:MM> (America/Los_Angeles).
//  Description: <short, clear one-line description of what this file does>
//
